Hey there! My name is Liliana Listus and I am a Ukrainian student at the 
University of Turku (Turku, Finland). 

I was born in Kiev, Ukraine, where I spent most of my life up until I moved to
Finland for my Master's degree. Being curious about how things work I have been 
following my passions and trying myself in many things, including music (I play
guitar, bass, drums and ukulele. I played in a band for && years), drama (once even wrote a script for a play and
we put it on stage), language (besides being fluent in 4 languages and basics of 3 more, I've studied small languages like northern sami and erzya).
I participated in some social projects like entratainmnent projects in orphanages and social projects at schools with a Canadian team.

I like organizing stuff, that is why while my exchange semester in Budapest I was organizing Russian language nights and in Turku Hungarian or
erzya language nights. I participated in organizing annual IFUSCO conference in Poland. 

I also like teaching, so naturally I loved my tutoring job at the Embassy of Finland and Hungary, as well as tutoring children. 

My other passion is technical stuff. I get super excited looking at the inner parts of a laptop, fixing stuff or writing code. It amazes me ot see
how blank text can become something visual like a web-page, or an app, or how with a couple of lines I could save myself from hours of 
copy-pasting of the translation of words for my Thesis. 

I also like bikes, travelling, which mostly is about visiting my many friends all over the world as well as discovering new stuff. I like beer, coffee and TV-series. 

My aim in life is to bring some impact. This is one of the reasons why I studied Finno-Ugric studies, with all the dying small languages that might be preserved for the future generations. 
And this is the main reason why I want to work in the tech field. It has tools to change reality.
